Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world around us. 
From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to 
self-driving cars and advanced healthcare diagnostics, AI systems 
are making tasks faster and more efficient.

However, with these advancements come challenges — such as 
ethical concerns, bias in data, and the need for transparency. 

Overall, the future of AI holds immense promise if developed 
and governed responsibly.


Love is not a word we say,
It hums beneath the breath of day,
In gentle looks that softly meet,
In silence where two heartbeats speak.

It grows where kindness dares to stay,
Through storms that wash our fears away,
It bends but never breaks apart,
A quiet rhythm of the heart.

Love is patience dressed in grace,
A candle warm in darkest space,
It learns, it forgives, it starts anew,
Each dawn a promise — me and you.

So let the years flow, calm or wild,
Love stays the same — tender, mild,
For hearts that choose to understand,
Hold forever in one hand.
